```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Install Lynis



```
apt-get install lynis
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
apt-get install apt-listbugs apt-listchanges checkrestart needrestart debsecan debsums fail2ban libpam-tmpdir libpam-usb debian-goodies apt-show-versions arpwatch 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
